Your response goes here!

    * What new skills have you learned?
    I have learnt about some new HTML tags such as <hr>, <footer> etc.

    * What has been easy?
    Since I already knew HTML before, what has been easy for me is to look at blog-mockup.png and edit index.html according to that.
    Even if I was not sure about using a certain tag, my research skills helped me look them up.

    * What has been difficult?
    Nothing has been difficult so far.

    * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    Research skills have helped me a lot in finding solutions to the problems I come across.
